Lisa Zhang: Good morning everyone. The main purpose of today’s meeting is to review the mobile app launch readiness and finalize our Q1 roadmap priorities.

Sarah Chen: As of now, the mobile app development is approximately 85% complete. Core features like authentication, dashboard, and notifications are implemented. Remaining tasks include performance optimization and fixing minor bugs reported during internal testing.

Marcus Johnson: From the engineering side, performance optimization will take about one week. We also identified a synchronization issue affecting Android devices. My team is already working on it and expects to resolve it by February 18th.

Priya Patel: The design work is complete. All user interface components have been finalized and delivered to engineering. I will conduct one final usability review once the performance fixes are done.

Tom Williams: Marketing preparations are on track. The launch campaign content is ready, including email campaigns, social media promotions, and website banners. However, we need the confirmed launch date to finalize scheduling.

Lisa Zhang: Based on engineering timelines, I propose we schedule the launch for February 25th. This gives enough buffer to fix remaining issues and prepare marketing.

Marcus Johnson: That timeline works for engineering. We can guarantee stability by then.

Sarah Chen: Agreed. I will update the roadmap and notify stakeholders about the confirmed launch date.

Discussion: Q1 Feature Planning

Sarah Chen: We analyzed user feedback from the past quarter. The most requested features are Dark Mode, Export to PDF, and Multi-user Collaboration.

Marcus Johnson: Dark Mode is relatively simple and can be implemented within two weeks. Export to PDF will take around three weeks due to backend integration requirements. Multi-user Collaboration is complex and will require at least two months of development.

Tom Williams: I recommend prioritizing Dark Mode and Export to PDF for Q1 since they deliver immediate value to users.

Lisa Zhang: That sounds reasonable. Let’s commit to Dark Mode and Export to PDF in Q1. Multi-user Collaboration will be planned for Q2.
