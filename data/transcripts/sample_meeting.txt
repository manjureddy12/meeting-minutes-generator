Lisa Zhang: Good morning everyone. Let's get started. The main agenda today 
is our Q4 product roadmap and the upcoming mobile app launch. 
Sarah, can you walk us through the current status?

Sarah Chen: Absolutely. So as of this week, we're about 78% complete with 
the mobile app. The core features — user authentication, dashboard, 
and payment integration — are all done and tested. What remains is 
the notification system and a few edge cases in the onboarding flow.

Marcus Johnson: I want to add some color there. The notification system is 
actually more complex than we estimated. We're dealing with both iOS 
push notifications and Android FCM, and there are some cross-platform 
inconsistencies we're still resolving. I'd say we need 2 more weeks 
for that specifically.

Lisa Zhang: Two more weeks puts us at November 29th. That's cutting it 
close to our December 10th launch date. Marcus, is there any risk 
of that slipping further?

Marcus Johnson: There's maybe a 20% chance we need one extra week beyond that.
I'd feel better if we moved the launch to December 15th as a buffer.

Tom Williams: From a marketing perspective, December 15th is actually better 
for us too. We have a campaign ready for the holiday season that would 
peak between December 15th and January 5th. A December 10th launch 
gives us only 10 days of peak holiday traffic, while December 15th 
gives us three full weeks.

Priya Patel: The design side is all complete. I've handed off all the final 
assets to Marcus's team. The only pending design task is creating the 
App Store screenshots and the promotional banner — I can have those 
done by December 1st easily.

Lisa Zhang: Great. Let's make the call — we're moving the launch to 
December 15th. This gives engineering the buffer they need, aligns 
with marketing's campaign, and still puts us in the holiday window.

Sarah Chen: Agreed. I'll update the project timeline in Jira and send out 
the revised schedule to all stakeholders by end of day today.

Discussion: Q1 2025 Feature Roadmap

Sarah Chen: Moving on to Q1 planning. We've collected 340 user feedback 
submissions over the past month. The top three requested features are:
1. Dark mode — requested by 67% of users
2. Data export to CSV — requested by 52% of users
3. Team collaboration features — requested by 48% of users

Marcus Johnson: Dark mode is low complexity — probably two weeks of work. 
CSV export is moderate, maybe three weeks. Team collaboration is a 
whole different level — that's a multi-month effort involving real-time 
sync, permissions management, and backend scaling.

Tom Williams: My recommendation would be to ship dark mode and CSV export 
in Q1 since they're quick wins that satisfy the majority of users. 
We can plan team collaboration as a Q2 or Q3 initiative.

Lisa Zhang: That sounds like a solid plan. Let's commit to dark mode and 
CSV export for Q1, with a target of shipping them by February 28th. 
Team collaboration goes on the Q2 roadmap for deeper planning.
